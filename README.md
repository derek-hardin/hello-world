This repo is for practicing the GitHub flow.

My name is Derek Hardin. I find the great thinkers before and during our time to be fascinating, and during my own spare time, I enjoy reading non-fiction books like computer science and philosophy. I am currently working on learning to code because I'm interested in building new things and seeing how human cognition can be expanded by computing.
